Self-taught frontend javascript developer. I build user-centric websites with functional and scalable components in mind. Since transitioning into software development in April 2020, I am proud to have launched 5 client projects, with 3 more currently in development and 1 in production. I have created 74 Github repos with 800+ contributions, participated in 1 open source project, and completed online courses totalling 150+hrs course time. I also have experience leading remote teams, managing large scale operations and working closely with data analysts.

It was as an operations specialist working with product teams and developers where I recognised my intrinsic joy for programming and made the decision to enter software development. 

I am eager to pursue much more work with JavaScript and React, am open to learning new tools & technologies and will bring to the table a positive attitude towards any challenges. Please check out my portoflio site at http://developersandbox.de.
