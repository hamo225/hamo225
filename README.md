It was as an operations specialist working with product teams and developers where I recognised my intrinsic joy for programming and made the decision to enter software development. I like building things, finding new ways for solving problems & am passionate about user-centric products. 

As a developer thus far, I have focused my efforts on non-profit initiatives, increasing their reach to their community and growing their user base. I learned to code while working with these initiatives and I am now looking for an opportunity to work alongside an enthusiastic team with the chance to learn and 10x my professional development. 

I am eager to pursue much more work with JavaScript and React, am open to learning new tools & technologies and will bring to the table a positive attitude towards any challenges.
